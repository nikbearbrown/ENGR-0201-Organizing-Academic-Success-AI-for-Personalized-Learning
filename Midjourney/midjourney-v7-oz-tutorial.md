# Creating a Modern Oz Manga and Film Storyboard: Ultimate Midjourney V7 Tutorial

This comprehensive tutorial will guide you through using Midjourney V7's powerful new features to create a manga-style storyboard for an animated film featuring a 27-year-old Dorothy returning to Oz. We'll leverage V7's Draft Mode, character creation, voice commands, and personalization features to rapidly iterate and build a cohesive visual narrative.

## Setting Up Your Midjourney V7 Workspace

### Activating Personalization
1. **Enable personalization** (now on by default but requires 5-minute unlock)
2. **Toggle it on/off** using the black/red "P" square icon
3. **Rate images** to refine your global style profile
4. **Create mood boards** for specific manga aesthetics

#### Personalization Command Examples:
```
/settings
```
Then select the personalization toggle. The P icon will be red when active.

### Understanding Draft Mode for Rapid Manga Panel Creation
Draft Mode is your secret weapon for quickly iterating manga panels, allowing you to make changes in seconds rather than minutes.

#### Basic Draft Mode Commands:
```
/draft
```
or
```
/imagine draft: a modern 27-year-old Dorothy standing at the edge of a wheat field, manga style
```

#### Setting Aspect Ratios for Manga Panels:
```
ar 16:9
```
or
```
square aspect ratio
```
or
```
ar 3:4 (standard manga page ratio)
```

## Character Design: Creating Your Modern Oz Cast

### Defining Adult Dorothy

Start by creating a character profile for your 27-year-old Dorothy that Midjourney can remember. **IMPORTANT: Use a unique identifier combining first and last name with no spaces** (e.g., DorothyGale instead of Dorothy) to prevent confusion with common words and other users' characters:

```
/imagine draft: Character DorothyGale: 27 years old, confident professional meteorologist, shoulder-length auburn hair with subtle blue highlights, practical field clothes with a modern blue gingham shirt, carries a weather tablet, ruby earrings as a memento, expressive eyes showing wisdom beyond her years. Detailed manga style with clean inking.
```

After generating, continue refining with nudge prompts:
```
Make her expression more determined
```
```
Add subtle scars from her first adventure
```
```
Show a small Toto-inspired dog tattoo on her wrist
```

#### Pro Tip:
Once you're happy with Dorothy's design, say:
```
Remember this character as DorothyGale
```
Now in future prompts, you can simply mention "DorothyGale" and MJ will recall these details. Using the combined name format prevents Midjourney from:
1. Confusing your character with its built-in knowledge of literary/film Dorothy
2. Mistaking the name for a descriptive word in longer prompts
3. Mixing your character with other users' similarly named characters

### Creating the Evolved Oz Companions

#### Modern Scarecrow:
```
/imagine draft: Character ScarecrowBrain: evolved intelligent advisor, wears spectacles and formal attire with straw accents, carries digital tablets and ancient scrolls, has developed a more human-like face but retains straw hair and stitched features. Academic posture. Detailed manga style with sharp line work.
```

#### Modern Tin Woodman:
```
/imagine draft: Character TinmanHeart: steampunk-inspired metal body with visible heart mechanism, polished chrome with copper accents, emotional eyes, carries an ornate axe with magical enhancements, decorative engravings showing his life story. Manga style with metallic highlights.
```

#### Modern Lion:
```
/imagine draft: Character LionCourage: regal posture, battle-scarred warrior, wears minimal golden armor on shoulders and chest, flowing mane styled with beads and small braids, confident expression, ceremonial weapon, stands upright. Anthropomorphic manga style with detailed fur texturing.
```

#### Remember each character:
After creating each design you're happy with, remember to say:
```
Remember this character as [combined character name]
```

**IMPORTANT:** Always use combined names without spaces (ScarecrowBrain, TinmanHeart, LionCourage) rather than generic terms (Scarecrow, Tin, Lion) to ensure Midjourney properly distinguishes your specific character designs from its general understanding of these concepts.

## Scene Creation: Key Locations in Your Modern Oz

### The Kansas Farm - Dorothy's Starting Point:
```
/imagine draft: modern Kansas farm with advanced weather monitoring equipment, drought-resistant crops, old farmhouse with technological updates, stormy skies approaching on the horizon, golden wheat fields, manga-style environmental storytelling with dramatic perspective. Clean linework with minimal color palette.
```

### The New Yellow Brick Road:
```
/imagine draft: deteriorated yellow brick road with high-tech brick replacements in some sections, magical plants growing between cracks, abandoned scarecrow warning posts, strange mechanical animals watching from distance, perspective view showing the road curving toward an evolved Emerald City skyline. Manga panel with dramatic angle.
```

### Evolved Emerald City:
```
/imagine draft: Emerald City reimagined as bio-mechanical metropolis, crystal spires mixed with organic architecture, floating transportation platforms, magical energy flowing through transparent conduits, citizens with diverse fantasy appearances. Detailed manga establishing shot with vertical panel composition.
```

## Storyboarding Techniques in Draft Mode

### Creating Sequential Panels

Start with an establishing shot:
```
/imagine draft: Dorothy standing at Kansas farm border during approaching storm, wind blowing her hair, clutching tablet showing weather anomalies, looking concerned toward darkening sky. Wide manga panel, dramatic lighting.
```

Then iterate with sequential panels through nudge prompts:
```
Show closeup of Dorothy's determined expression
```
```
Pull back to show storm forming a magical portal above
```
```
Show Dorothy being lifted by swirling magic winds
```
```
Dorothy falling through dimensional tunnel, surrounded by fragments of memories from her childhood
```
```
Dorothy landing in outskirts of evolved Oz, disoriented
```

### Using Voice Commands for Dynamic Scene Creation

Enable your microphone in Draft Mode and try voice directing scenes like:

*"Show DorothyGale discovering a broken section of yellow brick road with strange magical energy coming from beneath the cracks"*

*"Pull back to a wide shot showing DorothyGale being watched by mechanical crows perched on dead trees"*

*"Cut to DorothyGale hearing rustling in the fields and turning quickly, her hand reaching for her weather tablet as a defense tool"*

*"Pan across to reveal ScarecrowBrain emerging from the fields, looking very different than she remembers"*

*"Create a split panel showing DorothyGale's shocked expression on one side and ScarecrowBrain's uncertain recognition on the other"*

## Advanced Character Interaction Scenes

### Character Meeting Composition:
```
/imagine draft: DorothyGale and ScarecrowBrain reunion in wheat field, emotional moment, DorothyGale looking shocked at his evolved appearance, ScarecrowBrain adjusting spectacles in disbelief, magical particles floating around them signifying Oz recognizing DorothyGale's return. Manga-style emotional indicators, dynamic panel composition.
```

Then use combined character names for quick iterations:
```
DorothyGale stepping forward cautiously
```
```
ScarecrowBrain offering a book showing Oz's history since she left
```
```
Add LionCourage watching from distance
```

### Action Sequence Storyboarding:
```
/imagine draft: DorothyGale, ScarecrowBrain and LionCourage fleeing from mechanical storm crows, dynamic running poses, debris flying, LionCourage protecting others, DorothyGale using weather tablet to analyze attack pattern, multiple sequential action lines, manga speed effects. High-energy panel composition.
```

## Creating Both Photographic and Manga Styles

One of the most powerful features of Midjourney V7 is the ability to create both photographic realism and stylized manga art for the same characters. This provides tremendous flexibility for your Oz project, allowing you to develop concept art in multiple styles.

### Photographic Style Prompts:

#### Photorealistic Dorothy:
```
/imagine draft: Character DorothyGale: photorealistic portrait of 27-year-old meteorologist with shoulder-length auburn hair with subtle blue highlights, practical field clothes with modern blue gingham shirt, carries weather equipment, ruby earrings, natural lighting, high detail facial features, cinematic composition. --style raw
```

#### Cinematic Scene:
```
/imagine draft: DorothyGale standing at edge of yellow brick road, photorealistic cinematic style, golden hour lighting, 8K digital photography, atmospheric haze, detailed environment, high contrast, shallow depth of field focusing on her determined expression. --style raw
```

### Different Manga Art Styles to Try:

#### Classic Shōnen Style:
```
/imagine draft: DorothyGale confronting mechanical witch creature, action pose, dynamic lines, speed effects, dramatic lighting, exaggerated expressions, highly detailed background, shonen manga style with clear action lines. --style raw
```

#### Seinen Mature Style:
```
/imagine draft: DorothyGale examining ruins of witch's castle, sophisticated shading, realistic proportions, detailed architectural elements, atmospheric lighting, subtle expressions showing complex emotions, seinen manga style with crosshatching. --style raw
```

#### Shōjo Expressive Style:
```
/imagine draft: DorothyGale emotional reunion with TinmanHeart, flowing decorative elements, flower motifs, sparkle effects, expressive eyes, emotional symbolism, delicate linework, shojo manga style. --style raw
```

### Switching Between Styles:

To effectively switch between photographic and manga styles:

1. **Create base character designs in both styles**
2. **Save reference images of each style**
3. **Use style references when switching between styles:**
```
/imagine draft: DorothyGale in Emerald City --style raw --sref [URL of photorealistic DorothyGale]
```
or
```
/imagine draft: DorothyGale in Emerald City --style raw --sref [URL of manga style DorothyGale]
```

### Panel Layout Techniques:

#### Dynamic Action Layout:
```
/imagine draft: manga page layout with 5 panels: 1) Dorothy discovering approaching danger (top wide panel), 2-3) reaction shots of companions (small squares), 4) enemies appearing (medium panel), 5) Dorothy taking defensive stance (large bottom panel). Clear gutters between panels, manga reading direction indicators.
```

#### Emotional Focus Layout:
```
/imagine draft: manga page with focus panel structure: central large panel showing Dorothy's emotional realization that Oz has changed forever, surrounded by smaller memory panels showing original Oz experiences, decorative frame elements connecting panels, thought bubbles, emotional indicators.
```

## Adding Manga Text Elements

### Creating Text Bubbles and Effects:
```
/imagine draft: manga panel with Dorothy speaking to companions, empty speech bubbles of various shapes indicating different emotional tones, thought bubbles, action sound effects text in stylized English and Japanese onomatopoeia, motion lines, emotional symbols. Clean layout with space for dialogue.
```

## Building a Cohesive Visual Narrative

### Creating Style Consistency Across Panels

Use the '/prefer' suffix to maintain consistency:
```
/prefer suffix [image URL of your favorite generated Dorothy design]
```

Or use personalization through rating:
```
Rate highly consistent panels with your desired style to teach MJ your preferences
```

### Developing Visual Character Arcs:

#### Dorothy's Transformation Arc:
```
/imagine draft: 3-panel manga sequence showing Dorothy's visual evolution: 1) arriving in Oz looking uncertain and out of place, 2) mid-adventure with disheveled appearance but growing confidence, 3) final form with magical elements incorporated into appearance, standing confidently with evolved companions. Progressive panel composition.
```

## Specialized Scene Types for Your Oz Manga

### Dream/Memory Sequence:
```
/imagine draft: Dorothy's memory sequence of original Oz as child, hazy borders, desaturated colors except for ruby slippers, younger Dorothy with pigtails, simplified childlike versions of original companions, floating sepia-toned panels with wavy borders. Manga flashback indication lines.
```

### Magical Battle Sequence:
```
/imagine draft: Dorothy using weather control abilities gained in Oz, swirling storm elements around her hands, electricity crackling, wind effects shown with dynamic lines, opponents being pushed back, impact frames, manga energy visualization techniques, speed lines, reaction cutaways.
```

### Emotional Climax Scene:
```
/imagine draft: Dorothy making difficult choice to save Oz by combining modern technology with Oz magic, tears floating upward, magical energy surrounding her, companions reaching toward her, split lighting showing past and present simultaneously, symbolic imagery overlaid. Emotional manga climax panel with decorative borders.
```

## Exporting and Enhancing Your Storyboard

### Upscaling Key Frames:
Once you have draft panels you love, upscale them for final quality:
```
U1 (for first upscale variation)
```
or
```
/imagine [final prompt text from your draft] --v 7 --q 2
```

### Creating Transition Panels:
```
/imagine draft: transition panel showing yellow brick road morphing between different states of decay and renewal as Dorothy travels deeper into Oz, sequential transformation, manga page turn indicator. Minimalist style with focus on transformation elements.
```

## Utilizing Reference Images and Style Mixing

### Style Mixing for Unique Manga Aesthetics:

```
/imagine Dorothy standing at the gates of Emerald City --style raw --s 250 --sref [URL of manga style reference 1], [URL of manga style reference 2]
```

Use reference images with the style you want to achieve.

## Advanced V7 Techniques for Manga Storytelling

### Using Description Nudging for Manga Panel Development:

Start with a basic concept:
```
/imagine draft: Dorothy discovering old ruby slipper fragments
```

Then progressively build the panel:
```
Make it a closeup manga panel
```
```
Add dramatic lighting from below
```
```
Show Dorothy's hands carefully picking up a fragment
```
```
Add magical glow activating as she touches it
```
```
Show surprise in her eyes reflected in the ruby fragment
```

### Voice-Direct an Entire Sequence:

With microphone enabled, try describing a complete sequence:

*"Create a manga sequence where Dorothy and companions discover the witch's mechanical factory. Start with them approaching a dark mountain. Then show them finding an entrance. Next, show their shocked reactions as they see what's inside. Then create a dramatic reveal panel of mechanical creatures being built. Finally, show them being discovered by security systems."*

## Practical Workflow Tips

1. **Use proper naming conventions** - Always use combined names without spaces (DorothyGale, ScarecrowBrain, TinmanHeart) 
2. **Start with character designs** before attempting scenes
3. **Create both photorealistic and manga versions** of key characters for concept development
4. **Create environment establishing shots** to reference in later panels
5. **Work sequentially** through your story's key moments
6. **Save your best images** to use as reference for consistency
7. **Use Draft Mode** for quick iterations, then upscale final versions
8. **Reload the page** when starting a new sequence to avoid carrying over elements
9. **For complex scenes, build elements separately** then combine them in final compositions
10. **Create a character reference document** to redefine characters in new sessions

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Character Consistency Problems:
If Midjourney struggles to maintain character appearance between images:
```
Remember to use "Character [CombinedName]:" prefix when redefining them
```
```
Always use combined names without spaces (DorothyGale not Dorothy Gale)
```
```
Use detailed descriptions of distinct visual elements
```
```
Create reference panels showing character from multiple angles
```

### Name Recognition Issues:
If Midjourney isn't recognizing your character names:
```
Ensure your combined names don't contain spaces (DorothyGale, not Dorothy Gale)
```
```
Avoid names that might be interpreted as descriptive words
```
```
If a name isn't being recognized, try making it more distinctive (DorothyGaleOz instead of DorothyGale)
```
```
Remember character memory only persists within a single draft session
```

### Character Memory Duration:
When working on a multi-day project:
```
Character definitions only last within the current draft session
```
```
Starting a new draft session requires redefining all characters
```
```
Keep a document with all character definitions for easy reference
```
```
Create reference images for each character to use with --sref parameter
```

### Style Drift Correction:
If the manga style starts to drift toward realism:
```
Add "manga style, clean inking, panel composition" to prompts
```
```
Specify the exact manga style: "shonen manga," "seinen detailed style," etc.
```
```
Use --style raw parameter for more control
```

### Switching Between Photorealistic and Manga Styles:
If having trouble maintaining consistent character appearance across styles:
```
Create one definitive version in each style as a reference
```
```
Use --sref with the reference image URL of the appropriate style
```
```
Include clear style descriptors: "photorealistic style" or "manga style"
```
```
Consider creating separate character definitions for each style (DorothyGalePhoto vs DorothyGaleManga)
```

## Complete Project Example: Dorothy's Return to Oz Manga Opening

Here's a complete sequence of prompts to create the opening sequence of your manga:

1. **Title Page:**
```
/imagine draft: manga title page "DOROTHY'S RETURN" with adult DorothyGale silhouette against Kansas tornado sky, emerald city visible in storm clouds, dramatic manga title typography, author credit space, professional cover composition
```

2. **Opening Panel - Kansas:**
```
/imagine draft: Character DorothyGale: 27-year-old meteorologist with shoulder-length auburn hair, standing at farmhouse porch monitoring tablet showing storm anomaly, worried expression, practical field clothes with modern blue gingham pattern. Clean manga linework, establishing shot panel.
```

3. **Storm Development:**
```
/imagine draft: wide manga panel showing massive storm developing, DorothyGale in foreground taking readings, farm equipment being affected by strange energy, magical glints visible in clouds that only DorothyGale notices. Dramatic manga sky techniques.
```

4. **Transition to Oz:**
```
/imagine draft: 4-panel manga sequence: 1) DorothyGale engulfed by magical cyclone, 2) falling through dimensional tunnel with mathematical equations and weather patterns visible in tunnel walls, 3) glimpses of evolved Oz visible through tears in reality, 4) DorothyGale landing in field of strange new flowers, disoriented. Manga panel layout with dynamic action lines.
```

5. **First Oz Encounter:**
```
/imagine draft: DorothyGale meeting evolved ScarecrowBrain, now a magical-technological researcher, emotional reunion panel, both characters showing mix of recognition and surprise at how each has changed, magical particles floating in air, yellow brick road visible in background. Character-focused manga composition.
```

## Conclusion

Midjourney V7 represents a revolutionary tool for manga creators and storyboard artists, especially when creating a narrative as rich as an adult Dorothy returning to Oz. The combination of Draft Mode for rapid iteration, voice commands for intuitive direction, and character memory features allows you to focus on storytelling rather than prompt engineering.

Remember that the best manga storyboards balance visual consistency with emotional storytelling. Use these techniques to create a compelling visual narrative that captures both the nostalgia of the original Oz and the fresh perspective of seeing it through an adult Dorothy's eyes.

As you develop your Oz manga storyboard, continuously save your best images to build a reference library that ensures consistency across your entire project. With practice, you'll be able to create a cohesive manga-style narrative that could serve as the foundation for an animated film production.
