I'd be happy to develop Workshop 2 on effective prompting! Based on your workshop schedule, I'll create a comprehensive plan for a 1-hour session focused on prompting techniques for Claude.

# Workshop 2: Effective Prompting for Claude

This hands-on workshop teaches participants how to craft effective prompts to maximize Claude's capabilities. Starting with fundamental prompting principles, participants will learn about Claude's hybrid reasoning approach and how to leverage it effectively. The workshop introduces key prompt patterns including Persona, Template, Recipe, Explicit Reasoning, Alternative Approaches, and Reflection patterns through practical demonstrations and before/after examples. Participants will practice transforming vague queries into well-structured prompts, applying different patterns to real-world scenarios, and building a personal prompt library for future use. By the end of this session, attendees will have practical skills to significantly improve their interactions with Claude across various tasks including content creation, information analysis, problem-solving, and learning.

## Workshop Outline:

- **Introduction to Effective Prompting (15 min)**
  - Core principles: clarity, structure, context, examples, iteration
  - Understanding Claude's hybrid reasoning capabilities
  - The difference between traditional programming and prompt engineering

- **Demonstration: Prompt Patterns in Action (20 min)**
  - Basic patterns: Persona, Template, Recipe
  - Advanced patterns: Explicit Reasoning, Alternative Approaches, Reflection
  - Before/after examples for common use cases

- **Hands-on Exercise: Crafting Effective Prompts (25 min)**
  - Exercise 1: Basic prompt transformation
  - Exercise 2: Pattern application to real scenarios
  - Exercise 3: Task-specific prompting
  - Exercise 4: Building a personal prompt library
